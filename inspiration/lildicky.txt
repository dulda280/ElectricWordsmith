And y'ain't even want it with da boy
Cause the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I.
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

Shit, I'm living good up in this bitch
Dicky rollin round the city, blowin good up in that wip
I ain't black or Dominican, not Hispanic or Indian
So imprisonment is not a predicament, I envision
For a white boy
Hollatcha muthafuckin kike, boy
Higher than a muthafuckin kite, it's iight boi
They ain't suspicious of jews
I'll show contrition it's cool
Slap on the wrist, get ma daddy to choose
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise
Das what I do kid
Happy that my name ain't stupid
Dave coulda been Daquan with a few kids
But now I'm farting, overeating at meals,
If ain't I gotta theme party, Ion't be at goodwill
I'm dentist paying, tennis playing, smellin on some cabernet
And I ain't gay but if I was, everything would be okay, look...
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes
But ma premium channels mean tyler perry's never live
Getting tickets, they sick, I sit at the eagle 45
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive 

Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho
Happy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up
Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka
They up in heels
And tummy tuckin, theyon't grub except for takin them pills, foreal...
And ion't bleach shit
Ion't gotta eat dick
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis
Smoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing
In disagreements, I participate without weeping
And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that
Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut
So what up
Ya boy cut up
But eat butter
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother... to still love her
And I been getting better looking with age
But a guy can get who he deserves with a horrible face
Seal interlude
I go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake
And if impregnate I can pack a back and be on my way, but good luck girl!

Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man
First off I'm a dude so
There was a one in two chance of that sucking
But now I can run a seven minute mile
I can defend my self adequately
I can be logical
I can get along with my room-mates
Watch serious movies without being scared by them
And the on top of that I'm white
Which is like, amazing because
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country
I get my hair cut at a salon
People hold the door open for me which is nice
Er, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people
It ain't about that
It's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying?
But on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense
I've been thinking about that shit a lot
Because like if I could say the N-word, it would really help my rhyme scheme out
It's like the perfect filler word 

Ain't no doubt about it, shit is coming
And I'm just praying that Lil Dicky love it
Always told myself that this the type of shit I wanted
I was being honest, even made a promise
Not with anybody else, this was inner conscious
Talking to my fucking self, das' a little bonkers
I know, I still got a lot of shit to conquer
I hope that ain't even my concern though
You know I'll be working till I get what I deserve
Whatever totems I get personally you know I'ma earn those
This ain't even 'bout some shit up on a checklist
This about the fact that I'm about to test this
I'm about to figure out what my best is
I can't avoid it because now ya' boy invested
And I ain't gotta a choice except to smile and accept it
Pretty reckless, pretty restless 'cause
I've lived my life expecting love
To come the second my attempt was done, and yeah, I guess
To some extent I was correct because I'm getting buzz
But now I'm 'bout to be ubiquitous, look it up
Yeah, or that's at least what I'm assuming
But as alluded to reality is looming and
Now ya' dude about to make a move and take the truth
And hope to god that when he through
That what he thought about is proven
But honestly, I'm not afraid that it's delusion
I'm hot enough to where I know it's not illusion
But obviously I been finding this confusing
This ain't even close to what I thought I would be doing
Don't get me wrong, I was born to be big
But I always figured it would be the comedy thing
So I started rapping just to see what drama it brings
What big dogs from sitcoms would holler at me
And as the time past, I rhymed faster, lines crafted
Was high class as I mastered my craft, and
Goddamn, who'da thought it get like this
Back in twenty-ten music wouldn't make that list
I'm talking top five-to-ten strengths, with no winks
I would not lie, my pen dry, with no ink
Or, that's at least what I thought 'til I clawed and scratched the pen 'til I saw a line draw
Then I coulda let bygones be bygones
But I really wanted to rhyme till my line drawn
Like where the fuck is my peak at?
Not Brown but I make it pop, then I beat that
Not crowned yet, but I don't think I decreed that
Not loud, but you know I'm ready to tweet that
I just really hope I'm ready to be that
Now you seeing where D's at
'Cause even though I'm softer than a tissue
I ain't nothing to sneeze at
I'm smarter, where fuck ya' degrees at
And I ain't harder but I'm hotter homie, where da fuck ya degrees at
I'm 'bout to come in and desaturate
The chic rap today and evaporate
The feedback I hate, I elaborate
At a later date
But I'm getting off the point with the player hate
What the fuck was I saying, oh yeah
I'm kind of a slave
To my ambition, I ain't quittin' till my shit is appraised
And I admit it, I predict that where I finish is crazy
But that just means that it's further away
So, Burd about to work until he turn in his grave
It's really burdensome when earning something's fun for the day
But I'm concerned about da' burning out from upping the stakes
I'm always uppin' the stakes
I'm taking dinner meetings in New York, always up for the steaks
We exploring the discussion of great
They assuring me that when I'm more elite I'll be secure and amazed
But this isn't insecurity mang…
Like this the opposite of that, confidence in fact
My biggest problem is I can't honestly relax
Because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts
And I made a promise that I can't be the body
That's stopping it, think I need a lobotomy
Lil Dicky the prophecy, little bit of anomaly, not a commodity
Not a façade, or a lotta da Comedy prodigies
Commonly brought up wit Dicky
Feelin' weird, lemme think of an analogy
Just imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality
Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality
Was people that conform to the ruralest localities
To Russell though it was nuffin' but normality
And he really nice up on the plow in actuality
Everybody liked the kid and dug his personality
And so da mutuality was somewhat rationality
So then ya man made a plan of practicality
Not even a plan, it was more of a formality
Get a little land and attend to its vitality
Then raise a little fam 'til it all became finality
The strategy was just to stay in the course
And do ya chores, when ya' happy ya' ain't need to abort
Never explored nothing less he rollin' round on his horse
Then one day he was up on his horse
That's when he went past the porch, the path he normally
Passes forth was fast and short, was after more
Went faster north, amassed a lure to master more
And then discovered the court
He like ya! Let me down Tim
Hopped off, lookin' puzzled at the round rim
Saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then
Russell started dribbling and giggling astounded
Then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it
And when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin' sound friction
Up in a swish make and he was confounded
Because he knew that he had found him
But right now; it was still for the fun
Just a way to kill the time when the farming was done
Then the walking turned to running, and the hoppin' turned to jumping
And dunking, and Russell had to keep coming
Because the young'n was fucking disgusting and loving it
Running it, all of a sudden the public started to come in abundance and fuck wit him
'Cause he was butter and hungry, hung jury
'Cause stories of glory, not normally for people like him
Then the word got around up to ESPN
And they flying Russell down to compete in the gym
Bunch a grown men lookin' to belittle the kid
Because to those men, ball was the reason to live
And the G.O.A.T.S. they been all in since they was kids
So this goat owning mafucka look like a dick
And even know Russell knows that, he doesn't submit
He just chills with a grin
And then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge
Make it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men
Lookin' better than his predecessors ever could get
Turned the animosity to respect
And then the Thunder called him
Said they heard a lot about the ballin'
Told him that they wanna get involved and
Showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it's so appalling
Oklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty
Awesome, errbody laud him
Erry-bitty lookin' like they really fucking fallin'
Condominium is so legitimate it's sprawling
And this muthafucka on the court straight ballin'
Cash all up in that ass, lol'ing at the past like
Where the fuck would I be at up on the other path, right?
If I never stumbled 'pon the game then think of that life

Grab a seat
Thanks I'm Dave very nice to meet
Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg
Let me just check your sheet
No problem, sir, let me just say
I'm a big fan of the shit that y'all make
I can't lie, I been thinking about this all day
All good, there's a reason that we called, Dave
Let me start with your background
Where you come from?
Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond
Before that
Oh, you talking bout my hometown?
Yeah
I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around
So real shit you ain't never had to struggle for much
I wouldn't say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap
Elaborate
Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I'm cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping
Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
When you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps
Boo hoo what a hardship
How you paid to get the rap shit started?
Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don't diss me buddy, I wasn't one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must've wanted this a lot, I had something to choose
Look at that, I can say there's something to prove up in your ass
Yeah, I guess
That's enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?
Oh my God, it's the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It's never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It's kinda healthy
Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals
Sure
In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
Uh, I wouldn't do shit
And I don't even get what that got to do with this?
Shut the fuck up, rap's like life
If you wanna do this, then you won't get far acting like a little bitch
Nah, that's my niche
Don't get offended by this, but that's the market y'all missed
That's the target I'll hit
And that's the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different
What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time
But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?
Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don't know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don't mean any disrespect by that
I'm just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant

So what are your biggest strengths?
Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain't nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit in whatever cadence you bitches prefer
Alright, alright, I get it
Top of that, lyrically I'm pretty damn clever (Go)
Got a long bottom bitch, call the hoe Neville (Whoa)
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh)
You can say I'm pretty smart how I know better
And y'all been winning like Pistorius, there's no feet
Bro, I can go on and on
I'm taking over and they mad like father in laws
OK enough of the punchline, that ain't showing me you different from the other guys
Well I don't know if they can run it like that
But ain't nobody else doing funny type rap
What's that?
Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga
Oh this shit like a joke to you?
I don't get it
Nah it ain't like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like it's a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain't finna just lie
Real recognize real, right?
Yeah, I guess
So what you trying to do?
Five years from now, tell me bout the dude
Well, I don't care about the money
Like, it's the respect that I'm wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats
Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
I don't wanna leave the game the same
In a nutshell, what's your legacy?
Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet, the fans of rap start to recognize that anti-rap
Is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
That shit sound pretty damn complex
I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain't gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
I ain't mad at that
Well thanks, man, that's my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I'm a rap the plaques
And I ain't about to win them back to back
I'm bout to win them like it's back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping
You ain't even sold a damn album yet
True
That's a lot of talk from a wiley vet
Let alone a young rook nigga
You misread me
Nah this ain't a book nigga
Well that's one of my flaws, I'm too competitive dawg
No, you just fucking repetitive dawg
I get it, you trying to be better than all
But you ain't shit until cheddars involved
I get that I gotta prove myself
No shit you ain't done shit
But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I'm like this?
This shit is aight for your first shit
But you don't know if it's your worst shit
You don't think finding out would be worth it?
It might be, it might not
But I'm a put your ass to work, kid

People acting like I ain’t a fucking criminal
Like I ain’t never doing dirt though
Probably cause the way I’m doing shit is clinical
But I’ve been putting in some work, breh
I see you looking at me cynical, stop looking at me
I ain’t fucking with your smirk ho
We’ve been doing shit, despicable
But we just keep it on a low, for example
Walk in to the movie with my pants full
Twix, bag of chips, plus a Snapple
Stealing all the shampoos, from the hotel’s pretty bathrooms
Cheating, I’ve been peekin’ in the classroom
Looking like a nice guy, ‘til I take your motherfucking Wi-Fi
And torrent every single song in my library
Then I drive by very fucking high by everybody
While my lady licking my five inch dick

White crime
White crime
Yeah, we ‘bout that
Do a lot of dirt, never doubt that
Lot of rap twerps, let it shout crap
Let it make their mouth flat
When it come to burd, no, we spout facts
You 'gon learn what I’m 'bout, breh

Doing business at the airport
Ask security, I ain’t fraught
Lot of shit up in my JanSport
Six ounce of the face wash (the limit three)
My duffle bigger than what can board
My shuffle on during take-off
Will I help in an emergency? Yeah, sure
Exit row, fingers straight crossed
Thinking Dave’s soft
But I know you see me J-walking
Piss in public, no caution
Halloween bucket? Take one, fuck you thinkin’ Dave was
Give me all your motherfucking chocolate, ho
At the stop sign, never fully stopping though
Filling water cups up, with a lot of coke
Egging homes, motherfucker, a lot of yolk
Not alone up in this motherfucker, a lot of folks, been doing…

Even though the speeding limit sixty five
I’m doing seventy five without a seat belt on
And I’ve been texting, driving reckless
I was seventeen when I first tried a Guiness on the tennis team
We used to haze a lot of freshmen
Lil Dicky put a hoop up in the street
Without obtaining permission
From the city, and every Christmas day
I’m going to cinemas with single tickets to single flicks
But go to additional pictures, sorry, but your boy is malicious
And back when I was eighteen, statutory raping
This little ho, even though we was dating
And if I am taking public transportation
On the quiet train I might have a conversation
Fuck it I’m the man
Puitting trash up in some other people’s cans though
At the work fridge, stealing can coke
And up at the holiday party, I’m grinding colleagues on the dance floor
Dick been rubbing against their assholes, say it’s not…

Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L, The Jew Biz Major?
Fuck you know about the world he was raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie
Hair cut several months in-between, homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave, homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Air B&B the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm not in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer with the sale on it
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpay for it

I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shiz though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfucking finch though
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

Everybody know the cat like a dope meme
I got em' buzzing off the crack like a dope fiend
They saw em' come up with a Mac yeah I'm so Steve
Nowadays bitches tryna crack got 'em ODing
Like how them hoes want to get it with L
They know it's cold enough to charge like a letterman sale
If they gon' stand behind the bars I'm in federal jail
I'm going far like a general mail

On that note I got the fellas saying what up, the tape what up
The same mothafucker playing with his steak cut up
I'm great, shut up, the flowing no debate just us
I'm out of shape but I'm straight to fuck
Yeah you know I got a chicken in the condo
I was sick of getting off beat she a bongo
Now she playing with the hard D being Rondo
Drunk and go inside her all sweet like a Strongbow
How I'm'a do?

I got your ex coming next like a W do
I gotta flex, I'm the best, now I'm being direct
I'm unimpressed by these bitches that I see in the press
I'm kinda vexed by the trash like I'm cleaning a mess
Cus they as real when they rap as a Chias a pet
They old news stocks plummet! Men's leg hair they ain't cut it!
Forget about your era, Pat Summitt
Finesse writtens
I wanna get a hundred bitches and fuck with the spitting
Religious like a couple of post-marital Christians
I've been official, Dick Bevetta a living
You better dig it like you bitches got a mill in the ditch
I'm killing this shit I been kicking like a villainous ninja

My shit is gripping when I run it how the fuck I be slippin
I be intimate with them hoes, she never flummoxed
I take chick, pee and smash, I call it hummus
And I be funny with this shit, I'm just playing
But still nobody fucking with the kid I'm just saying

Ah! Got a chicken parm on the date it seem
But I don't even know the broad, she just grating the cheese
I don't even got a job I just blaze and free
But still they give a boy bands, 98 degrees
So come fuck with me
I got a couple hundred bitches doing drugs with me
And I got a couple dozen bitches tryna hug Dicky
And I got a couple bitches who be steady fucking me

Hey, that's a good ass life
Only thing I got left find a good ass wife
But yo I gotta hit these hoes first, don't tell Mom
But in a year I'm'a bend over Michelle Obama
Bruh you know I gotta do it while I'm hot
I'm tryna get blew in most states like Barack
I'm tryna show a boo the last name of the Rock
And put her on D till we O, J Watt

I never hit the scene when I do I'm high and wasted
I'm fucking with them jeans love them bitches high waisted
I run around your team, you a player but I'm Naismith
And I Command V, while you copy I just paste it, face it

Hotel got 'em puffing on the L, going harder than some hell
You ain't knew it
If everybody had to tell the truth and you had to pick a dude
Spitting better than your dude: can't do it
Telling me damn you got bitches, damn you got hoes
Damn you got money, but damn I got flow
Damn you got riches, damn you got clothes
Damn you got honeys but damn I got soul

Hold up. This shit I'm making's always tight it's like a yoga store
They all up in the other boat it's why I'm overboard
I'm taking time to do it right it's like a soda pour
Cus we ain't loving all you bitches like we spoken for
I been packing the band-wagon, the man cracking
The man packing the stands, had them clapping they hands
Tagging they ‘grams, Manhattan was ham
Slapping the fans, playing havin' the plan
Fans rapping the jams, sagging my pants

You see the type of shit I do on the track?
Hot shit like I poop in the jacket
Won't mack your bitch but yo I'm bout to come and mack your clique
Your whole friend group fucking with Dick (no hetero)
I yawn when I hear these motherfuckers on the radio
They ball all retarded Cuba Gooding up in Radio
I long for the moment I can say that's not debatable
I'm past that, I wonder who appreciate it like a Snapchat
Aflac, duck the dude, I'm going hard for the grind but I tuck this move

I made war with the rhymes, motherfuck your crew
These bitches going Adolf, tryna fuck this Jew
I'm too nice like a motherfucker that fell in love with a boo
Twice as in double as fuckable as he was
And dude tries to be subtle and get her cuddling
Venting her troubles and getting her truffles and ending up
Befuddled when she don't fuck him and someone tell him listen
You bugging she never fucking a pedestrian muggle like you
So why all the trouble but he rebuttal with
I think I just love her so I would shudder at the thought
Of being anything other than nice

(I’m that nice)
Heat bang like I caught a body/Port-A-Potty
It wasn't even deep dang shit is still a hobby
It's too bad bitches sleeping on me threesome
Cus now these bitches want to help but he don't need none
I'm all time like the Wall at the Bank
You've no shot like you drawing a blank
Honestly you probably couldn't hang man
I've been drawing a blank
Giving you lines while you sitting there and drawing a blank
So go in the rink, chilling like it's dough in the bank
And I’m flowing danker than a grower in Napa
Growing the stankest cannabis
Doing rap and pro-est smacking the hoe-est rappers
And showing the total package like my flaccid is growing fatter
Samoan cracker dapper rapper had to keep goin
Yeah that rap is a rap I know you rappers napping don't know it
There’s a dagger pita pappa-tapping on the window
It’s a real accurate metaphor of what you having in store
And I be snapping I mean I be splashing on the
Pane me your rain, fallin
Quicker than Aladdin for his dame
Are you better than me?
Bruh
