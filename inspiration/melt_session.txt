Take a ride on my train of thought
Fundamentals what I bought
Penniless, I await the emptiness enlightened
Twenty six years on earth, my soul fighting
Habits that ain't happen, my body has took a liking
To my lifestyle, battling stress the size of goliath
Sling shots plus hard rocks, these stones getting thrown
My temptations are amplified when I get alone
Tried to separate the action from the man
I wholeheartedly understand
Why I need to grow even though I'm grown
If I did you wrong, I vow to make it right
Judge me off appearance, it was said to me, I'm impolite
Eyes remain in freeze mode, I'm stuck in fight or flight
I'm deflecting my daily problems within my daily life
Recognize hidden patterns of my own demise
Why I feel like hiding a truth is finding a lie?
Dealt with thoughts of suicide, women I've objectified
Couldn't see it through my eyes so for that, I apologize
I'm just hypnotized, working hard to empathize
Strung out on love addiction
And groupies when souls collide
I've been this way since the day I turned six
I've been touched before, way before I touched my
Now I'm almighty pushing through the pain
The almighty cushion to the flame
The birds and burning bushes in my brain
I had to make an effort, double overtime to change
Had to journal my journey and mistakes I made on the way
Manipulation to get what I want
Getting very distant after I got what I need
Writing rap and wisdom, whiskey, women, wars and weed
Narrating all these conflicts, then top it off with greed
I keep walking, I keep walking, I keep walking
Me and my so called best friends don't speak often
Blaming me for everything
When they can't point fingers at they selves
So be grateful I offered the help
Being aware is my definition of melt
My eyes eating perfections within myself
Cracked images, bad luck, and broken mirrors
Funny how I see in permanent so clearer
I dedicate this to the ones I hurt
It's time to get my spirit right on earth
Before my sins become a evil curse
Conquer thirst, can't revert to who I was at first
I channel God through this verse
Accountability, I take responsibility
For all my actions, I packed them in these soliloquies
Just because we're not friends don't mean we're enemies
Thank you all for listening
Sending why all with good energy
